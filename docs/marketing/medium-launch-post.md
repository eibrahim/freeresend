# Introducing FreeResend: The Open-Source, Self-Hosted Alternative to Resend

*Finally, a drop-in replacement for Resend that puts you in control of your email infrastructure*

---

Let me start by saying this: **I absolutely love Resend**. The developer experience is phenomenal, the API is beautifully designed, and it just works. As someone who's built countless side projects and client applications, I've relied on Resend time and time again for transactional emails. It's hands down one of the best email services out there.

But here's the thing ‚Äî when you're running multiple side projects, managing client work, or trying to keep costs down while scaling, those monthly bills start adding up fast. I found myself constantly calculating email costs across different projects, wondering if there was a more economical way to achieve the same great developer experience.

That's when I decided to build **FreeResend**.

## Why FreeResend?

### üí∞ **Cost-Effective from Day One**

Instead of paying per email or monthly subscription fees, FreeResend leverages **Amazon SES** for actual email delivery. This means you pay Amazon's incredibly low rates (as little as $0.10 per 1,000 emails) instead of premium pricing. For my side projects alone, this has saved me hundreds of dollars annually.

### üöÄ **True Drop-in Compatibility**

Here's the beautiful part: you don't need to rewrite a single line of code. FreeResend implements the exact same API as Resend, which means your existing code works immediately:

```javascript
// Your existing Resend code
import { Resend } from "resend";

// Just change the base URL - that's it!
const resend = new Resend("your-freeresend-api-key");

const { data, error } = await resend.emails.send({
  from: "onboarding@yourdomain.com",
  to: ["user@example.com"],
  subject: "Hello World",
  html: "<strong>it works!</strong>",
});
```

Set `RESEND_BASE_URL="https://your-freeresend.com/api"` as an environment variable, and you're done. No migration headaches, no learning new APIs.

### üè† **Complete Control with Self-Hosting**

When you self-host FreeResend, you own your email infrastructure. No vendor lock-in, no surprise pricing changes, no limits imposed by external services. Your email data stays on your servers, and you can customize everything to fit your needs.

### ‚ö° **Lightning-Fast Setup with Digital Ocean Integration**

This is where FreeResend really shines. While Digital Ocean integration is completely optional, if you're using DO for DNS (like I do for most of my projects), FreeResend becomes incredibly powerful:

**Without FreeResend**: Setting up a new domain for emails means manually creating 5-7 DNS records:
- TXT record for SES domain verification
- MX records for receiving emails
- SPF record for sender policy
- DMARC record for email authentication
- 3 CNAME records for DKIM signing

**With FreeResend + Digital Ocean**: Add your domain, click verify, and **all DNS records are created automatically**. From domain to sending emails in under 60 seconds.

For developers managing multiple client projects, this alone is worth the switch.

## Real-World Impact

Since launching FreeResend for my own projects, I've:

- **Reduced email costs by 85%** across 12 active side projects
- **Cut domain setup time from 15 minutes to under 1 minute** per project
- **Eliminated vendor dependency** while maintaining the same great DX
- **Gained complete visibility** into email delivery and performance

## Built for Developers, by a Developer

FreeResend is **100% open source** and designed with the developer experience as the top priority:

- **Next.js 15** with TypeScript for modern development
- **Direct PostgreSQL integration** (no external database dependencies)
- **Comprehensive API logging** and webhook support
- **Docker-ready** for easy deployment
- **Production-tested** across multiple client projects

## Getting Started Takes Minutes

1. **Clone and install**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/eibrahim/freeresend.git
cd freeresend && npm install
```

2. **Configure your environment** (database, AWS SES, optional DO)
3. **Run the setup**: `npm run dev`
4. **Add your first domain** and start sending emails

The entire setup process is documented step-by-step, and I've included test scripts to verify everything works correctly.

## Open Source and Community-Driven

FreeResend is released under the MIT license because I believe great developer tools should be accessible to everyone. Whether you're a solo founder bootstrapping your startup or an agency managing client projects, you shouldn't have to choose between great developer experience and cost efficiency.

The codebase is designed to be:
- **Easy to understand** and modify
- **Well-documented** with comprehensive setup guides
- **Actively maintained** with regular updates
- **Community-friendly** with clear contribution guidelines

## What's Next?

I'm actively using FreeResend in production across multiple projects, and the roadmap includes exciting features like:
- Email template management
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- SMTP server support
- Enhanced webhook retry mechanisms
- Multi-user team support

But most importantly, I'm building this with the community. Every feature request, bug report, and contribution helps make FreeResend better for all developers.
